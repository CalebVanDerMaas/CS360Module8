The app that I developed is a line chart that displays a user's weight changes over time. The goal of the app is to visualize the user's weight fluctuations and help them track their progress.

The main screen of the app is the line chart, which is necessary to display the user's weight data. The chart uses the MPAndroidChart library to draw the line and axes, and allows the user to see their weight changes over time.

To design the user interface, I used the MPAndroidChart library to create the line chart and added the user's weight data. I also made sure to label the chart with appropriate titles and axis labels so that the user can understand the data being displayed. My designs were successful because they effectively visualized the data in a clear and understandable way, making it easy for the user to track their progress.

To code the app, I used Java and the Android Studio development environment. I imported the necessary libraries and used the provided methods to create the line chart and add the weight data to it.

To test the functionality of the code, I ran the app on an emulator to see if the line chart was displayed correctly and the weight data was displayed accurately. Testing is important because it helps ensure that the app is working as intended and that the user experience is smooth.

During the development process, I had to troubleshoot any issues that arose with the chart or data display. This involved researching solutions and experimenting with different approaches.

In this app, I demonstrated my knowledge and skills in using the MPAndroidChart library to create and customize a line chart, as well as my experience in using Java and the Android Studio development environment to build an Android app. I was particularly successful in using the library to effectively visualize and track the user's weight changes over time.
